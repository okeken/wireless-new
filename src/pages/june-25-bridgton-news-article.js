                Todd Morton, the Wireless Outdoor Cinema Company owner, was
                interviewed at his home in Bridgton, Maine, on June 20, 2020.

                Todd Morton has had a diverse working career. He has done
                construction, finish carpentry and built a couple of log homes.
                And he worked 25 years as an Internet marketer and website
                designer. Now he hopes to add the Wireless Outdoor Cinema
                Company to his professional accomplishments.

                “I want to create an outdoor experience that the entire family
                will enjoy,” he said.
              </p>
              <p className="sm:text-23 text-base press-text font-extralight pb-5">
                Todd has always had a great appreciation for the outdoors and
                grew up in northern Vermont. His true passions have always been
                working outdoors and nature. For years, Todd thought about
                putting up a backyard movie screen for years and started testing
                various outdoor set ups that turned out to be flimsy or too
                cumbersome to setup and watch.
              </p>
              <p className="sm:text-23 text-base press-text font-extralight pb-5">
                During the winter, Todd continued researching outdoor cinema
                setups but found most failed to hold up due to uneven ground
                conditions and wind. “I brainstormed for months how I could set
                up a sturdy, rugged stationary movie screen frame, that I
                wouldn’t have to inflate or deflate at the end of the movie and
                make it look aesthetically clean on my property,” he said.
              </p>
              <p className="sm:text-23 text-base press-text font-extralight pb-5">
                Todd built a pressure-treated movie screen frame, which can
                easily be moved by two people. All hardware used on the outdoor
                wooden frame is weather-resistant galvanized and stainless
                steel. “This frame is built to last,” he said. The cinematic
                polyester screens come in three sizes – 96”, 120” and 150” and
                attach to the frame with grommet holes and stainless steel
                hooks. To put the screen on the frame takes less time than it
                does to pop a bag of popcorn in the microwave, Todd said.

                  “You can set up the wireless outdoor cinema anywhere on your
                  property. After watching my first movie outside, I knew other
                  homeowners would love this experience. Being outside in the
                  fresh air seeing the galaxy of stars and moon is incredible,
                  nothing beats the experience,” he said. I envision people
                  watching movies outside with family and friends, having
                  Halloween parties in October, watching the Super Bowl, all you
                  need to stay warm in the cooler months is a good old fashion
                  campfire or a propane heat lamp. And with social distancing,
                  you can spread out lawn chairs and still safely watch a movie,
                  sporting event, play video games together with friends.”

                The HD Wi-Fi projector (which is positioned six to seven feet
                away from the screen) sets on either a projector stand or a
                custom-build cedar projector stand with shelves. The off-grid
                battery station powers the outdoor cinema where there’s no need
                to run any extension cords out to the electronic components. And
                the off-grid battery comes with a built-in flashlight to help
                with finding your way back inside.
