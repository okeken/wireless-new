                  BRIDGTON, MAINE – August 28, 2021 – The Wireless Outdoor
                  Cinema Company,
                </strong>{" "}
                a premier provider of complete outdoor movie theater solutions for homeowners and businesses, today announced the availability of the new Timberline Outdoor Cinema Series. The new reinforced frame system is included with the purchase of each of the three Timberline option packages: the 96” Jedi Bobcat Outdoor Gaming Cinema ($2,499); the 120” Bella Bear Backyard Outdoor Cinema (starting at $2,399); and the 150”  Big Moose Premium Outdoor Cinema (starting at $2,899).

              <p className="sm:text-23 text-base font-extralight pb-5 press-text">
              The more stable new frame system, that supports the cinematic screen, can withstand strong wind gusts, rain storms and snow. There’s no need to break it down, deflate or shove back into a box since it is designed to remain outdoors year-round. The new frame features newly added front bottom 45-degree angle supports and new heavy-duty post and beam weather-resistant hardware. Customers who previously purchased an outdoor cinema package will receive the new frame system.
