                  Cinema Company
                </strong>{" "}
                today announced the new Timberline Outdoor Cinema Series with a
                new and improved frame system to attach the cinematic screen to.
                The new frame system is more sturdy and durable than the
                original frame that was introduced last year.
              </p>
              <p className="xl:text-23 text-base font-extralight pb-5 press-text">
                The new frame system was redesigned to give the frame more
                stability if unexpected strong wind gusts hit the screen while
                attached to the frame. In addition, the bottom supports to the
                frame were improved by adding front bottom 45-degree angle
                supports and new heavy-duty post and beam weather-resistant
                hardware.
